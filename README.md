<h2>Project Title</h2>

<h3>Cine Explore</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>

It is a movie search site, where you can see data such as running time, genre, description and also an evaluation. This site consumes the API of TMBD (The Movie Database) is an awesome API that you can use to build movie related projects. The website features responsive design and utilizes popular web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NextJS, BootStrap, Axios, React-icons, Api-Context. The user interface includes a navigation bar, home section and a details section.

<h2>Main difficulties</h2>

<h3>Keep data</h3>

<p>When the user reloaded the page, the web-site losed the current movie data, giving to user a fake error.</p>

<h3>How i solve</h3>
<p>
    
The best solution to this problem was not to depend of a State to recived the id of the movie and so use the pathname property present on the useRouter() hook.
